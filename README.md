# IOT-Smart-Cooker
ESP32 code for a full automatic cooker that can be operated from a remote location. It dispenses rice and water and then switches on the stove. After a preconfigured delay, the stove is automatically switched off.

Upload the code in 'SmartCooker.c' to ESP32.
The server running on the microcroller would poll the cloud API and initiate the cooking process when requested from the mobile app.
